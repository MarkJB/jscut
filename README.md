jscut
=====

A simple CAM package that runs in the browser. Very new, very alpha.

Live version at http://jscut.org/jscut.html

The master branch tends to be stale; the gh-pages branch is current, including bug fixes. The live version pulls from gh-pages.

To compile that cpp to js, you need to install gcc (mingw) and emscripten. The latter needs to be activated in the terminal you are going to be compiling from (e.g. ..\emsdk\emsdk activate latest)

You also need the boost library...
